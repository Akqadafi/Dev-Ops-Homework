1. What You’ll Build and How You’ll Run It

You’ll create a small Terraform project (two files), initialize Terraform in that folder, and validate the config. You’ll use Git Bash and VS Code, not PowerShell or “random” editors.

2. Install the Correct Programs

* Terraform CLI
* Gitbash
* VS Code

3. Create a Working Folder

1. Go to **Start** and type in **Gitbash(DON'T USE POWERSHELL)
2. Click to **Run as Administrator**
3. run aws sts get-caller-identity to authenticate AWS.
4. Use the `cd` command to move to desired directory
5. Create a folder for your Terraform files using the `mkdir` command. Give it a suitable name (include the date)
6. Use the `pwd` command to ensure you are in the right folder

4. Create Authentication File

1. Create a file with this command:
   `touch 0-auth.tf`
2. Run `ls` to check file is created
3. Run `pwd` to double check you are in the right folder

5. Open VS Code in the Folder*

1. Type `code .`
2. Go to:
   [https://github.com/Akqadafi/Class7-notes/blob/main/102125/00-auth.tf](https://github.com/Akqadafi/Class7-notes/blob/main/102125/00-auth.tf)
3. Copy the code located in the GitHub
4. Paste the code into the file **"00-auth.tf"** file
5. Press **Ctrl+S** to save (**VERY Important**)
6. Run `cat 0-auth.tf` to ensure you copied the correct code

6. Initialize File

1. Open a terminal in VS Code

   * At the top of VS Code, click the three dots to open a dropdown
   * Click **“New Terminal”** or use shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+`**
   * Select **Gitbash** from the terminal dropdown
2. Run `ls` to check on files in folder
3. Run `terraform --version` to ensure you have Terraform installed

7. Run Initialization Commands

1. Run:
   `Terraform Init`
2. You are successful if several new files show up in the folder:

   * A folder named **.terraform
   * A file named **.terraform.lock.hcl
   * **DO NOT TOUCH THESE FILES!

8. Download Gitignore File

In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash
curl -O --ssl-no-revoke https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaron-dm-mcdonald/aws-image-resizer/refs/heads/main/.gitignore
```

DO NOT TOUCH THE GITIGNORE FILE!

Run:
`ls -a -ln`
to see all your files.

9. Validate and Apply Terraform

1. In terminal, run `terraform validate`

    Success message: “Success! The configuration is valid”
2. Run `terraform plan`
3. Run `terraform apply`

   * Success should produce a **terraform.tfstate** file in the folder
   * The **terraform.tfstate** file is very sensitive. **DO NOT TOUCH THIS FILE!**

10. Verify Your Files

Run `ls` to check your files.
You should have:

* 0-auth.tf
* .terraform.lock.hcl
* terraform.tfstate
* .terraform folder
